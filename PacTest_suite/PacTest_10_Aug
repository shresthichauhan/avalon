hardware products in the chain of manufacture or distribution to End Users and only to others in such chain of manufacture or distribution and to End Users for use sole
ly as a server management tool for the Intel hardware-based server board or system (the "Intel Hardware") for which the Software is provided, as listed in the documenta
tion accompanying the Software or as posted on the Intel website from which You obtained the Software. 
C.	copy and distribute the end-user documentation which may accompany the Software, but only in association with the Software. 

2.	PATENT LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Intel grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide patent license under Licensed Patent Claim

ense, when that Software is in its unmodified form as delivered by Intel to You and not modified or combined with anything else. 

3.	ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.  

A.	The Software is protected by the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries, and international treaty provisions. An essential basis of
